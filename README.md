I recently had to write a program from which I needed to extract numbers from a string...but was not able to complete it properly in time.
So this is me trying to figure out how to do it. I will improve the program as I learn more via experience and guidance, but as of right now
it is a base for programs that would require integers to be extracted from a string...I am pretty sure it can account for all sorts of strings,
but who knows, maybe I will find an exception that will need to be patched.
